3. 🔄 **Support analytics**: Track support request patterns to optimize the process

## 🔧 **How to Re-enable (Future Reference)**

If password reset functionality needs to be restored in the future:

### **High-Level Steps**
1. **Restore removed files** from git history:
   - `src/features/auth/pages/ResetPasswordPage.tsx`
   - `src/features/auth/pages/ForgotPasswordPage.tsx`
   - `src/services/passwordResetService.ts`
   - `src/schemas/auth/passwordReset.ts`

2. **Update AuthContext** to include `resetPassword` method

3. **Restore routes** in App.tsx for password reset flows

4. **Update AuthForm** to include "Forgot password?" link

5. **Configure Supabase** with appropriate redirect URLs

6. **Add back exports** in feature index files

7. **Update tests** to cover password reset scenarios

### **Considerations for Re-implementation**
- **Security review**: Ensure all security measures are properly implemented
- **UX testing**: Validate the complete user experience
- **Email templates**: Configure and test email delivery
- **Documentation**: Update user and developer documentation
